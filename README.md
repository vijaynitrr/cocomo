The COCOMO models are defined for three classes of software projects. Using Boehm's terminology these are: (1) organic mode–relatively small, simple software projects in which small teams with good application experience work to a set of less than rigid requirements (e.g., a thermal analysis program developed for a heat transfer group); (2) semi-detached mode –an intermediate (in size and complexity) software project in which teams with mixed experience levels must meet a mix of rigid and less than rigid requirements (e.g., a transaction processing system with fixed requirements for terminal hardware and data base software); (3) embedded mode –a software project that must be developed within a set of tight hardware, software and operational constraints (e.g., flight control software for aircraft).

The Basic COCOMO equations take the form:

E = a * pow(KLOC,b)

D = c * pow(E,d)

where E is the effort applied in person-months, D is the development time in chronological months and KLOC is the estimated number of delivered lines of code for the project (express in thousands).
